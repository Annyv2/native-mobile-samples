# Auth0 + iOS + Custom UI

This seed project shows how to build your own Login UI and call Auth0 to authenticate your users.

## Configuring the example

You must set your Auht0 `ClientId` and `Domain` in this sample so that it works. For that, just open the `Evilation/Info.plist` file and replace the `{CLIENT_ID}` and `{DOMAIN}` fields with your account information.

## Running the example

In order to run the project, you need to have `XCode` installed.
Once you have that, just clone the project and run the following:

1. `pod install`
2. `open Evilation.xcworkspace`

Enjoy your iOS app now :).
